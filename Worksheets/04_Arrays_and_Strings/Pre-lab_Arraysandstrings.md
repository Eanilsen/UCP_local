## 1. Array Declarations ##
a) Declaration of an `int` array allocating memory for 14 integers.

b) Declaration and initialization of a `double` array. Memory for 4 double values
 are allocated.

c) Declaration of a multi dimensional `float` array.

d) Declaration of an array of `int` pointers.

e) Declaration of a multi-dimensional array containing 3 arrays with 4 arrays each.
 Each of the 4 arrays contains pointers to pointers to `void`.

f) Declaration and initialization of a character array. This is C's equivalent
 of a string.
    ```
    s = {'H','e','l','l','o','\0'};
    ```

g) Declare `s` as a pointer to a `char` array containing `"Hello"`. This is known
 as a *read-only string* because `s` is only a pointer and not a freely modifiable
 array.
